       "- Water system status: main reservoir critically low due to drought; reservoir water is contaminated with E. coli; distribution infrastructure aging; local water-quality lab nonfunctional.\n",
       "- Fiscal constraints: limited emergency funds; potential access to state/federal emergency assistance but needs clear requests and justification.\n",
       "- External capacity: external labs and state public health resources are available but may have limited capacity; possible need to rent or deploy mobile testing and mobile treatment units.\n",
       "- Unknowns with the most impact: exact level and persistence of reservoir contamination, the time required to restore safe supply, the capacity to deploy bottled-water and mobile-treatment assets, and the speed with which alternative safe-water sources can be scaled up.\n",
       "\n",
       "(a) Immediate lifesaving measures (today through 48–72 hours)\n",
       "Goal: prevent waterborne morbidity and mortality while you test and stabilize. Actions prioritize vulnerable groups and ensure basic drinking and hygiene needs, with rapid socialization of risks and actions.\n",
       "\n",
       "1) Declarative actions and public health protections\n",
       "- Issue an emergency public health declaration and activate the city emergency operations center (EOC) if not already active.\n",
       "- Establish a centralized, transparent public information portal (24/7 updates) with plain-language guidance on drinking-water safety, boil-water instructions, and where to obtain bottled water and water-distribution sites.\n",
       "- Create a prioritization framework for water distribution (see section on ethics).\n",

       "- Time: immediate setup; ongoing daily operations.\n",
       "- Cost: mostly personnel and communications; minor operational costs at start (estimated $50k–$200k initial for setup, content production, and communications, depending on existing capacity).\n",
       "- Expected morbidity/mortality impact: high if no action; with declaration and clear messaging, risk of inappropriate use and panic reduces; qualitative uncertainty high to moderate.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Boil-water advisory and disinfection guidance\n",
       "- Issue a city-wide boil-water advisory for all drinking and food-preparation uses at all public and private facilities; publish altitude-adjusted boil time if applicable (usually 1 minute at rolling boil; longer at higher elevations).\n",

       "1) Expand and optimize bottled-water access and alternative safe-water routes\n",
       "- Scale up distribution capacity (more sites, mobile delivery, 24/7 operations as needed) to reach all neighborhoods, with a focus on high-poverty areas and medically vulnerable households.\n",
       "- Implement a water-resilience plan for essential institutions (hospitals, schools, shelters) including back-up power, redundancy in water supply lines, and rapid testing at point-of-use.\n",
       "\n",
       "Resource implications\n",
       "- People: expanded logistics team (15–40 staff); volunteer coordination; security at distribution sites.\n",
       "- Time: 7–14 days to reach steady-state distribution; ongoing thereafter.\n",
       "- Cost: $5–15 million, depending on scale (bottled water volumes, transport, staffing, site setup).\n",
       "- Expected morbidity/mortality impact: substantial reduction in water-related illnesses; uncertainty depends on coverage and duration.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Establish interim laboratory testing capacity (even with a nonfunctional city lab)\n",
       "- Contract or partner with state/public health labs and private labs for routine E. coli, total coliform, turbidity, residual chlorine, and contaminant testing.\n",
       "- Implement a standardized sampling plan across the distribution network (number of samples, frequency) and ensure rapid turnaround (24–48 hours for most tests, longer for some analyses).\n",
       "- Move toward a simple, auditable QA/QC program and data-sharing with the city and the public.\n",
       "\n",
       "Resource implications\n",
       "- People: dedicated lab liaison, contract-lacrosse network; 2–4 full-time equivalents (FTEs) for coordination; lab technicians as needed.\n",
       "- Time: 48–72 hours to establish contracts; ongoing testing cadence.\n",
       "- Cost: testing costs depend on volume; rough daily testing budget could be $20k–$200k depending on frequency and lab type; initial setup could be $200k–$1M.\n",
       "- Expected morbidity/mortality impact: improves confidence in safety and allows more targeted actions; uncertainty high if test coverage is uneven.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Public health risk communication and behavioral guidance\n",
       "- Provide clear, consistent messaging about boiling, safe handling of water, and when to seek care for diarrheal illness.\n",
       "- Use multiple channels (TV, radio, SMS, social media, community leaders) in multiple languages; hold regular press briefings.\n",
       "- Launch trust-building measures to reduce misinformation and political polarization: transparent dashboards, a public FAQ, and open data sharing.\n",

       "- Expected morbidity/mortality impact: reduces risk for vulnerable groups; uncertainty moderate.\n",
       "\n",
       "5) Data-driven targeting and equity controls\n",
       "- Start a district-by-district water-access map showing which areas have reliable access, which are dry, and where bottlenecks exist.\n",
       "- Use vulnerability data (age, health status, income) to reallocate resources to the highest-need neighborhoods.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Phase transitions and triggers\n",
       "- Phase A (Immediate lifesaving measures: 0–3 days)\n",
       "  - Trigger to enter Phase A: confirmation of E. coli presence in reservoir or distribution system; boil-water advisory issued citywide; essential water-distribution points established.\n",
       "  - Exit trigger: none; move to Phase B when a stable interim supply with clear coverage for high-priority populations is in operation for at least 72 hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phase B (Short-term stabilization: days–weeks)\n",
       "  - Triggers to remain Phase B: (1) coverage of safe water to ≥85% of residents in a 5–7 day rolling window; (2) external lab results showing no active contamination or contaminant trend; (3) ability to sustain at least two concurrent safe-water routes (bottled water and treated water) for at least 14 days; (4) a functioning system to monitor water quality with 24–48 hour turnaround.\n",
       "  - Trigger to escalate to Phase C: sustained supply to ≥95% of residents with confirmed safe water at central testing sites for 14 days; plan in place for source replacement or interconnection if needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phase C (Medium-term recovery: weeks–months)\n",
       "  - Triggers to escalate from Phase B to Phase C: (1) new supply arrangement (interconnection or alternative source) legally secured and functioning; (2) distribution system improvements deployed (new tanks, piping work) with completion milestones; (3) local lab capacity fully restored or replaced with external lab capacity; (4) risk to vulnerable populations is reduced as measured by service access and disease surveillance.\n",
       "  - Exit criteria for Phase C: stable, ongoing safe-water supply with automated monitoring and QA/QC program in place for at least 3 months; no sustained contamination signals; written recovery plan enacted.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phase D (Long-term resilience and plan normalization)\n",
       "  - Triggers to stay Phase D: permanent upgrades completed; drought contingency plan activated; systemic readiness for future events; routine public-health water quality surveillance in place.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key public-communication and governance note\n",
       "- Maintain public transparency about what is known, what is not known, and how decisions are made (including ethical trade-offs). Use a public dashboard with data on water quality, supply coverage, and distribution equity. Explain the rationale for rationing or prioritization using explicit ethical principles (see below).\n",
       "\n",
       "(g) Assumptions and the most important unknowns your plan depends on\n",
       "- Assumptions:\n",
       "  - The city can rapidly mobilize external testing capacity and bottled-water supply at scale.\n",
       "  - Alternative water sources or interconnections can be established within weeks to months.\n",
       "  - Governance can negotiate inter-jurisdictional agreements and funding approvals in a timely manner.\n",
       "  - The population will respond to communications and use the water guidance appropriately.\n",
       "- Most important unknowns:\n",
       "  - The exact extent and persistence of reservoir contamination and whether any contaminants exceed safe levels for extended periods.\n",
       "  - The capacity and speed to deploy mobile treatment units and interconnect with neighboring utilities.\n",
       "  - The rate at which households and institutions will adopt boil-water guidance and water-use restrictions.\n",
       "  - Financial availability and speed of federal/state support.\n",
       "  - The reliability of external testing partners and the turnaround time for results.\n",
       "  - The potential for secondary health effects (e.g., load on healthcare facilities, mental health impacts from water insecurity).\n",
       "\n",
       "Ethical and legal trade-offs: how to justify to the public\n",
       "- Core ethical framework: prioritize the most vulnerable and essential services; maximize lives saved; use equity-centered distribution; ensure transparency and accountability.\n",
       "- Rationing and prioritization: \n",
       "  - Give priority to hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities, shelters, and schools serving vulnerable populations.\n",
       "  - Provide baseline safe-water access for all residents, with additional supplies for vulnerable households (elderly, immunocompromised, children).\n",
       "  - If shortages persist, implement a transparent tiered allocation system that is publicly documented and auditable; avoid favoritism by relying on objective criteria (household need, size of household, disability status, and risk level).\n",
       "- Use of nonpotable sources:\n",
       "  - If nonpotable sources are to be used (e.g., graywater for non-drinking uses or treated non-potable options in limited contexts), ensure strict safety barriers and legal compliance; clearly communicate limits and the rationale, and clearly separate nonpotable uses from drinking water.\n",
       "  Ethical justification: emergency situations justify temporary measures that reduce risk and save lives, provided they do not create greater harm, include safeguards to protect the most vulnerable, and are transparent in rationale and duration.\n",
       "- Public communication and trust:\n",
       "  - Be explicit about uncertainties and the plan to reduce them; provide regular updates on data quality, supply status, and timelines.\n",
       "  - Acknowledge constraints and trade-offs; invite public input and provide channels for concerns.\n",
       "  - Ensure accessibility and language equity in communications to reach all communities.\n",
       "\n",
       "What to do next: concrete set of ready-to-execute steps\n",
       "- Immediate\n",
       "  - Activate EOC and declare emergency status; appoint incident commander.\n",
       "  - Issue boil-water advisory; publish authoritative guidance.\n",
       "  - Establish primary and alternate water-distribution sites; begin bottled-water provisioning at scale; target highest-need facilities first.\n",
       "  - Initiate external lab contracts and a sampling plan; set 24–48 hour turnaround for core tests.\n",
       "  - Launch public communication plan with daily briefings and a single, trusted source of truth.\n",
       "- 0–7 days\n",
       "  - Scale up bottled-water procurement and distribution; begin mobile-treatment deployments.\n",
       "  - Implement interim interagency MOUs with neighboring utilities or state agencies to secure alternate supplies.\n",
       "  - Begin district-based water-use planning and equity targeting; begin data governance and dashboards.\n",
       "- 1–4 weeks\n",
       "  - Complete interim testing plan; validate external lab results; adjust guidance as needed.\n",
       "  - Start infrastructure resilience planning and procurement for emergency upgrades; advance interconnections if feasible.\n",
       "  - Sign off on a multi-week to multi-month recovery plan with clear actions and milestones.\n",
       "\n",
       "- 1–6 months\n",
       "  - Implement long-term water-supply solution (interconnection, new treatment capacity, or alternate supply).\n",
       "  - Initiate permanent resilience improvements (infrastructure upgrades, QA/QC lab capacity, data systems).\n",
       "  - Transition from emergency governance to a formal resilience and drought-management program.\n",
       "\n",
       "Important caveats\n",
       "- All estimates (costs, timelines, and health impacts) are highly contingent on external factors: availability of bottled water, lab capacity, interconnection approvals, and the political environment. Prepare to adjust rapidly.\n",
       "- Ensure legal clearance for emergency expenditures and inter-jurisdictional agreements; coordinate with the state attorney general’s office for any waivers or authority required during an emergency.\n",
       "- Maintain a strong focus on protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring equity throughout the response.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you’d like, I can tailor the plan to your city’s exact population, existing infrastructure, and the specific legal/regulatory framework you must operate under, and convert the above into a 2–3 page executive directive with a phased Gantt-style timeline and a cost envelope."

OpenAI built these endpoints and they became very popular. So a lot of people decided that they would offer endpoints with exactly the same format, same spec as OpenAI.
